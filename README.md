This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl programming: improper error handling that leads to abrupt script termination. The `bug.tcl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides a more robust alternative. The primary issue lies in the use of `exit 1` within the error handling procedure, which immediately stops script execution without providing opportunities for logging, cleanup actions, or alternative error handling pathways. The improved version employs more sophisticated techniques to manage errors.
